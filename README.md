# Advent of Code

Solutions for the https://adventofcode.com/2021.

Each day is on a different csproj as a dotnet 6 console app. (all under a single sln)

As requested for the page the test sets are not updated so you would need to add a input.txt file on each solution with the desired input to run.

## TBD
1. simplify some solutions
1. add some sort of performance testing of the solutions ( maybe using https://github.com/dotnet/BenchmarkDotNet)
